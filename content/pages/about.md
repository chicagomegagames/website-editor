# About Us

Hi, we're Chicago Megagames. You might remember us from such games as [My Kind of Town](/games/my_kind_of_town/) or [Watch the Skies](/games/watch_the_skies/). Perhaps you have heard of us by way of one of our many regular playtests or Design Jams? 

We're a collection of friends from all sorts of fields who share a common hobby in megagaming. This is our current board of directors:

- Charlie Graham
- Don Kuntz
- Jeff Levrant
- Tony Phelps
