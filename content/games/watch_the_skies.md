The year is 2020. and while there are still no _Back to the Future II_&ndash;style hoverboards, there have been more than a few aliens buming around Earth for a few decades.
After recently making their presence known, the governments of the world have started making brief diplomatic contact with the aliens.
While entirely in the dark on the aliens&rsquo; plans, the governments are striving to keep knowledge out of the hands of the general populace (not entirely seeing the irony).
As the common saying goes, &ldquo;a nation freaking the hell out cannot stand,&rdquo; or something like that.
