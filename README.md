# website-editor

`website-editor` intends to be an easy-to-use web frontend for managing and creating static websites.

This project is currently maintained by Chicago Megagames.
Because of this, most new development around it goes towards making it easier to manage [chicagomegagames.com](https://chicagomegagames.com).

Development and feature requests are currently managed in Trello.
The board can be found at [https://trello.com/b/uU2pM1Nj/website-editor](https://trello.com/b/uU2pM1Nj/website-editor).

Currently the `fabfile.py` is geared specifically towards deploying this application to the CMG server.
It should be fairly easy to port to other servers as needed.
